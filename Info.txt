Invoke-WinGetOperation.ps1


This script wraps around the winget.exe binary to provide enhanced usability for install, uninstall and list (detection) operations via Intune or SCCM.

Additionally, this script logs all transactions to disk, colour-codes errors and extracts install failure exit codes and provides it to the caller, plus more.
